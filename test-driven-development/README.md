# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** version 18
- **Yarn** for package management

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `yarn install`

Installs all the project dependencies.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more details, refer to [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed.\
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy the configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project so you have full control over them.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The default setup is suitable for most small to medium projects, and you should only `eject` if you need extensive customizations.
